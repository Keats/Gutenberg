Gutenberg only has 3 commands: init, build and serve.

You can view the help of the whole program by running `gutenberg --help` and
the command help by running `gutenberg <cmd> --help`.

## init

Creates the directory structure used by Gutenberg at the given directory.

```bash
$ gutenberg init <my_site>
```

will create a new folder named `my_site` and the files/folders needed by
Gutenberg.

## build

This will build the whole site in the `public` directory.

```bash
$ gutenberg build
```

You can override the config `base_url` by passing a new URL to the `base-url` flag.

```bash
$ gutenberg build --base-url $DEPLOY_URL
```

This is useful for example when you want to deploy previews of a site to a dynamic URL, such as Netlify
deploy previews.

You can override the default output directory 'public' by passing a other value to the `output-dir` flag.

```bash
$ gutenberg build --output-dir $DOCUMENT_ROOT
```

## serve

This will build and serve the site using a local server. You can also specify
the interface/port combination to use if you want something different than the default (`127.0.0.1:1111`).

```bash
$ gutenberg serve
$ gutenberg serve --port 2000
$ gutenberg serve --interface 0.0.0.0
$ gutenberg serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 2000
$ gutenberg serve --interface 0.0.0.0 --port 2000 --output-dir www/public
```

The serve command will watch all your content and will provide live reload, without
hard refresh if possible.

Gutenberg does a best-effort to live reload but some changes cannot be handled automatically. If you
fail to see your change, you will need to restart `gutenberg serve`.
