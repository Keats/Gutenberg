A page is any file ending with `.md` in the `content` directory, except files
named `_index.md`.

If a file ending with `.md` is named `index.md`, it will generate a page
with the name of its directory (for example, `/content/about/index.md` would
create a page at `[base_url]/about`). (Note the lack of an underscore; if the file
were named `_index.md`, then it would create a **section** at `[base_url]/about`, as
discussed in a previous part of this documentation.  In contrast, naming the file `index.md` will
create a **page** at `[base_url]/about`).

If the file is given any name *other* than `index.md` or `_index.md`, then it will
create a page with that name (without the `.md`). For example, naming a file in the root of your
content directory `about.md` would create a page at `[base_url]/about`.
Another exception to this rule is that a filename starting with a datetime (YYYY-mm-dd or [an RFC3339 datetime](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)) followed by
an underscore (`_`) or a dash (`-`) will use that date as the page date, unless already set
in the front matter. The page name will be anything after `_`/`-`, so the file `2018-10-10-hello-world.md` will
be available at `[base_url]/hello-world`. Note that the full RFC3339 datetime contains colons, which is not a valid
character in a filename on Windows.

As you can see, creating an `about.md` file is equivalent to creating an
`about/index.md` file.  The only difference between the two methods is that creating
the `about` directory allows you to use asset co-location, as discussed in the
[overview](@/documentation/content/overview.md#asset-co-location) section.

## Front matter

The TOML front matter is a set of metadata embedded in a file at the beginning of the file enclosed
by triple pluses (`+++`).

Although none of the front matter variables are mandatory, the opening and closing `+++` are required.

Here is an example page with all the available variables. The values provided below are the
default values.

```TOML
title = ""
description = ""

# The date of the post.
# Two formats are allowed: YYYY-MM-DD (2012-10-02) and RFC3339 (2002-10-02T15:00:00Z).
# Do not wrap dates in quotes; the line below only indicates that there is no default date.
# If the section variable `sort_by` is set to `date`, then any page that lacks a `date`
# will not be rendered.
# Setting this overrides a date set in the filename.
date =

# The weight as defined on the Section page of the documentation.
# If the section variable `sort_by` is set to `weight`, then any page that lacks a `weight`
# will not be rendered.
weight = 0

# A draft page is only loaded if the `--drafts` flag is passed to `zola build`, `zola serve` or `zola check`.
draft = false

# If set, this slug will be instead of the filename to make the URL.
# The section path will still be used.
slug = ""

# The path the content will appear at.
# If set, it cannot be an empty string and will override both `slug` and the filename.
# The sections' path won't be used.
# It should not start with a `/` and the slash will be removed if it does.
path = ""

# Use aliases if you are moving content but want to redirect previous URLs to the
# current one. This takes an array of paths, not URLs.
aliases = []

# When set to "true", the page will be in the search index. This is only used if
# `build_search_index` is set to "true" in the Zola configuration and the parent section
# hasn't set `in_search_index` to "false" in its front matter.
in_search_index = true

# Template to use to render this page.
template = "page.html"

# The taxonomies for this page. The keys need to be the same as the taxonomy
# names configured in `config.toml` and the values are an array of String objects. For example,
# tags = ["rust", "web"].
[taxonomies]

# Your own data.
[extra]
```

## Summary

You can ask Zola to create a summary if, for example, you only want to show the first
paragraph of the page content in a list.

To do so, add <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code> in your content at the point
where you want the summary to end. The content up to that point will be
available separately in the
[template](@/documentation/templates/pages-sections.md#page-variables).

An anchor link to this position named `continue-reading` is created, wrapped in a paragraph
with a `zola-continue-reading` id, so you can link directly to it if needed. For example:
`<a href="{{ page.permalink }}#continue-reading">Continue Reading</a>`.
