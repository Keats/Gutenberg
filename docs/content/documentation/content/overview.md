Gutenberg uses the folder structure to determine the site structure.
Each folder in the `content` directory represents a [section](./documentation/content/section.md)
that contains [pages](./documentation/content/page.md): your `.md` files.

```bash
.
└── content
    ├── content
    │   └── something.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/content/something/
    ├── blog
    │   ├── cli-usage.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/cli-usage/
    │   ├── configuration.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/configuration/
    │   ├── directory-structure.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/directory-structure/
    │   ├── _index.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/
    │   └── installation.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/blog/installation/
    └── landing
        └── _index.md // -> https://mywebsite.com/landing/
```

Each page path (the part after the `base_url`, for example `blog/cli-usage/`) can be customised by changing the `path` or `slug`
attribute of the [page front-matter](./documentation/content/page.md#front-matter).

You might have noticed a file named `_index.md` in the example above.
This file is used to store both metadata and content of the section itself and is not considered a page.

To make sure the terminology used in the rest of the documentation is understood, let's go over the example above.

The `content` directory in this case has three `sections`: `content`, `blog` and `landing`. The `content` section has only
one page, `something.md`, the `landing` section has no page and the `blog` section has 4 pages: `cli-usage.md`, `configuration.md`, `directory-structure.md`
and `installation.md`.

While not shown in the example, sections can be nested indefinitely.

## Assets colocation

The `content` directory is not limited to markup files though: it's natural to want to co-locate a page and some related
assets.

Gutenberg supports that pattern out of the box: create a folder, add a `index.md` file and as many non-markdown files as you want.
Those assets will be copied in the same folder when building the site which allows you to use a relative path to access them.

```bash
└── with-assets
    ├── index.md
    └── yavascript.js
```

By default, this page will get the folder name (`with-assets` in this case) as its slug.

It is possible to ignore selected asset files using the
[ignored_content](./documentation/getting-started/configuration.md) setting in the config file.
For example, say you have an Excel spreadsheet from which you are taking several screenshots and
then linking to those image files on your website. For maintainability purposes, you want to keep
the spreadsheet in the same folder as the markdown, but you don't want to copy the spreadsheet to
the public web site. You can achieve this by simply setting `ignored_content` in the config file:

```
ignored_content = ["*.xlsx"]
```

## Static assets

In addition to placing content files in the `content` directory, you may also place content 
files in the `static` directory.  Any files/folders that you place in the `static` directory
will be copied, without modification, to the public directory.  

Typically, you might put site-wide assets (such as the site favicon, site logos or site-wide
JavaScript) in the root of the static directory.  You can also place any HTML or other files that
you wish to be included without modification (that is, without being parsed as Markdown files)
into the static directory.
